### What I Do

- 🎮 **Game Development:** I create games for multiple platforms, from personal and client projects to rapid prototypes developed in Game Jams. My focus is on turning ideas into fun and interactive experiences.

- 🔧 **Embedded Systems & IoT:** I dive into low-level programming with C and microcontrollers, blending my game development background with hardware. My passion lies in creating tangible, game-oriented devices (like custom joysticks and controllers) that bridge the gap between physical interaction and digital play.

- 🧠 **Continuous Learning:** I'm always studying and applying new concepts in software engineering, data structures, and AI, looking for ways to bridge the knowledge between game development and embedded systems.

### 💻 Tech Stack

- **Game Development:** `GameMaker`, `Godot`, `Unity`
- **Embedded Systems & IoT:** `C`, `Arduino Platform`, `Raspberry Pi`, `ESP32`
- **Other:** `Git`, `JavaScript`, `HTML/CSS`, `Python`

### ✍️ Where I Write

I share my experiences, learnings, and the journey between game development and embedded systems on my blog. My first post, **"[Patro Powered by Passion: Games, Systems, and Infinite Learning](https://dev.to/patrocinioluisf/patro-powered-by-passion-games-systems-and-infinite-learning-52f1)"**, details my career path and how I connect these two fields.
